    paragraph: `Hungry 4 Biscuits was started in the summer of 2022 by our founder and current President, Hana Gurz. Inspired by her mother, who always kept rolls of biscuits to give to anyone hungry, Hana wanted to extend this kindness across the Inland Empire.\n\nThe club began with small biscuit distribution events and quickly grew as more people joined the cause. Over time, Hungry 4 Biscuits has expanded its activities, organizing weekly distributions of all sorts of food, partnering with local businesses and clubs to de-stigmatize food insecurity, and raising awareness about food accessibility issues in the community.`,
